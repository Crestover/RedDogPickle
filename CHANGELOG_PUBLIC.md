# What's New

## v0.3.1 — Live Referee Console

### Added
- Live session page redesigned as a single-screen scoring console. Team selection, scores, and the Record button are all visible without scrolling.
- Each player row now has explicit A and B buttons for direct team assignment. No guessing which team you're adding to.
- Live game ticker shows the last recorded result at a glance — score, team codes, and time.
- New "All Games" page for browsing the full game log of any session.
- Pairing dot indicators show how often partners and opponents have been matched this session.
- Courts Mode waiting pool now uses horizontal scroll chips. Tap a chip to assign a player to an open court slot.
- Courts Mode controls (court count, Suggest All, Void) now stick to the bottom of the screen on mobile.
- Fairness summary line in Courts Mode shows which players have the fewest and most games.

### Improved
- Session page is cleaner: standings and pairing tables moved off the live view. Use the Standings link to see analytics.
- Only the Record Game button uses a filled green style. All other buttons are outline-only for a calmer interface.
- Ended sessions show a simple game log instead of analytics.
